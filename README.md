Applying basic knowledge of git, github and html to build odin recipes website.

Started by creating a github repository, cloning it on my local system, created files and folders on the local repo, applied knowledge of html to build recipe pages for Guacamole, Homemade Chili and Buffalo Chicken Dip. Each recipe page contains (1)Recipe Name (2)Recipe Image (3)Recipe Description (4)Recipe Ingredients and (5)Recipe Steps. Recipe pages were hyperlinked on index.html page (Odin Recipes) leveraging my knowledge of lists, anchor elements and relative links.
